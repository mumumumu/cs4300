Code for assignments from CS4300 - Information Retrieval at Cornell University. We were given a lot of freedom in what language we wanted to work in, so I decided to write everything in Python as a learning experience. Fair warning for anyone taking the course that stumbles across this, don't copy paste any code from here, if you're paying attention in lectures at all you should know why ;)
