Multiple Term - Since the assignment stated the search function would only be used for single term queries, the program will not accept multi-termed queries even if there are possible results.
	Enter a single term query: library software
	No results found for - library software

Invalid Term - Given an search term that does not occur in the pages, the program will tell you that no results could be found.
	Enter a single term query: hack
	No results found for - hack	

Invalid + Valid Term - As before, the program only allows for single term queires, so even if the query contains one valid and one invalid term, it will no return any results.
	Enter a single term query: software hack
	No results found for - software hack
